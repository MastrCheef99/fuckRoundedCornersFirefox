# Fuck Rounded Corners

## About:
Join the sharp side. Sharp corners are sleek, efficient, and robotic in a world where websites try to be playful and kiddified.
The screenshot above was taken with the mode as `round all corners the same amount` and with a Corner Radius of `0`.

With this extention you can also create the opposite asthetic, by using the `round all corners using a ratio relative to the shortest side` mode with a value of `0.5` and a max of `30`, searchbars, buttons, and the like will all end in circles.
